# Life_Expectancy_Forecasting
Life expectancy is the average number of years that a person is expected to live. In this project, one simple linear regression model and two multiple linear regression models are fitted by choosing the variables from the dataset. Then, the best model is chosen to predict the life expectancy.

###### Aim: To find out the variables that highly correlated to the life expectancy and use the best model to predict the life expectancy.
